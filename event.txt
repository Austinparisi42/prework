The event assignment was actually the hardest for me. I have been working a crazy schedule and I've had a lot to take care of this summer, so getting out of the house aside from work is a rarity for me. This may not be the exact experience you want, but it's the closest I've come recently. Some friends of mine wanted to try out table top Warhammer, so I decided to join them. I went to the store that sells and hosts the game, and I spoke with the guy who worked there and the people playing the game. I had them explain things to me and help me get what I needed to get started on my first army. In a sense this was networking. I instilled myself in a new community that I had no ties to previously, and gave myself something to focus on outside of responsibilities.
