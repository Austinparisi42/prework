		<h2>Bio</h2>
			<p>Harley Poe is a horror infused folk-punk band out of Indiana. While that may be a mouthful there aren't many better ways to describe them.</p>
			<p>Their songs range from grotesque to hilarious while accomplishing both simultaneously more often than not. While many songs are nods to classic horror movies, most comment on human beings being the monsters in a light hearted, mostly silly way that can only be compared to that of a B-horror movie.</p>
