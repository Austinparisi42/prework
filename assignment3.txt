Personally my biggest challenge is going to be persistence. Number 10 on the list (Fixing things takes time) is a daunting realization, although it's not the first time I've been told this. Admittedtly my biggest weakness is keeping myself from becoming discouraged when confronted with a problem that I can't figure out after a few tries. The idea if working on a problem and coming up with nothing for several hours is very discouraging to me. One of my main focuses during this course is going to be fixing that problem and learning how to think in different ways to solve a seemingly impossible problem. When I fail to find a solution I tend to have a hard time changing my approach to the problem. I think this may just be because I am so unfamiliar with coding. In the additional reading learning to code was compared to learning English before ever learning the sounds that make up the language and I feel like that is a big part of my problem. With help from fellow students and hands on teaching I'm hopeful that I can overcome my weaknesses and tackle this new skill set.
